      a)This program simulates a Texas Hold’em poker game using two decks
      b)As a user, I can click “play the game” so that I can start the simulation that determines the best hand between me and the dealer
    	As a user, I can click “play again” to play again
      c)Software runs. It randomly generates 5 cards for each person’s hands, compares them,   and determines which hand is stronger
      d) As a user, I can click “fold” to give up if my hand is too weak
          As a user, I can click “bet” to bet some chips 
          As a user, I can click “Add player” to add more players
          As a user, I can click “check” to stay with my hand
      e) The Readme could be more specific in that it’s just a random simulation with all the cards already picked out. It could also add a link to poker rules for those who don’t know how to play. It could also add instructions on how to build and run the project (like you need to type ant cards first before you do ant run).
      f)jws stuff that needs to be updated/removed
     g) Issues: There is plenty we can work on. Implementing Raise, Call, Check, etc. will require us to add new game mechanics, not to mention the inclusion of some type of money to the game. If we have time, then maybe we can incorporate multiplayer, either local or online. 
     h) additional issues: https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-pokergame/issues/5\
     i) -PokerGame sets up the GUI
        -Card class with value and suit attributes; only has  constructors and getters and setters
        -Deck class with ArrayList of all the cards; can deal (5 cards at a time), discard, and reshuffle the deck 
        -Hand class is subclass of ArrayList; supposed to represent a hand of 5 cards; has methods to discard, draw, and sort the cards; this is the class that determines the winner of the hand (has methods to check for all possible card combinations), including if both players have the same highest combination 
       -HandTest is the tester class for this program
      Some notes:
	-Why is Hand extending ArrayList and not Deck? Why is Hand even extending ArrayList in the first place? Why not just have an ArrayList private instance variable?
	-the code for sameHand in the Hand class is confusing. Needs more comments. Also, not sure of the difference between it and sameHandMethod
	-alot of nested if statements in the methods that check the type of hand, probably could refactor out some of those into methods(ex: see alot of: (sortedHand.get(i)==sortedHand.get(i+1))
	-the way it’s currently organized is fine; dependencies are clear; no useless classes
     Dependencies : PokerGame depends on Hand and Deck, Hand and Deck depend on Card, Hand and Deck depend on each other
	
j) There are JUnit tests for testing hand comparison accuracy of the Hand class. Only the Hand class is covered by testing. We could extend test coverage to include Deck (test dealing/reshuffle/discard methods). We can add tests to test new game mechanics ( raise, call, check).
