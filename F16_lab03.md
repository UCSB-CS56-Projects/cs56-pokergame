# Kurt Madland and Wesley Peery
*a)This is a simmulation of a poker game with up to 4 players. Turns and betting are not currently working
*b)As a player I can read the rules so that I can understand the game. As a player I can view the statistics to find out how many games each player has won. As a player I can click "Click To Play" but nothing happens.
*c)It runs the main menu but when you choose "Click To Play" nothing happens. You can view the rules and statistics.
*d)As a player I could click "Click to Play" to make the game run.
*e)The ReadMe could be formatted in bullet points to make it easier to skim. Other than that the content seems good.
*f)The build.xml file is in good shape. All of the targets have descriptions and each one appears to work.
