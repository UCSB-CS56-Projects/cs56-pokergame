a) This project simulates a texas holdem pokergame with up to 4 players.

b) As a user I can click "Rules" so that the program displays the rules.
   As a user I can click "Click to Play" so that the game starts.
   As a user I can click "Statistics" so that the number of wins each
   player has is displayed.

c) The software runs. The application allows you to view the rules and
   statistics, as well as start a game between 2-4 players. However
   There are no turns and whoever initially has the best hand wins.

d) As a player I can bet, raise or fold so that I complete my turn.
   As a player I can quit the game so that I can return to the main
   menu.
   As a user I can click hide/show so that the players cards alternate
   between hidden and visible.
   As a user I can end my turn so that no one else can see my cards.

e) The Readme is in good shape and it gives a good breif overview of the
   code. However it could be formatted so that it's easier to skim.

f) The build.xml file contains a "linenumbers" target that creates a
   file with the linenumbers added. This target may not be needed anymore.

g) It is possible to earn 1000pts with this project. The issues are clear.

h) Issue: https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-pokergame/issues/22

f) ##Card.java
