a) This project simulates a texas holdem pokergame with up to 4 players.

b) As a user I can click "Rules" so that the program displays the rules.
   As a user I can click "Click to Play" so that the game starts.
   As a user I can click "Statistics" so that the number of wins each
   player has is displayed.

c) The software runs. The application allows you to view the rules and
   statistics, as well as start a game between 2-4 players. However
   There are no turns and whoever initially has the best hand wins.

d) As a player I can bet, raise or fold so that I complete my turn.
As a player I can quit the game so that I can return to the main
   menu.
   As a user I can click hide/show so that the players cards alternate
   between hidden and visible.
   As a user I can end my turn so that no one else can see my cards.

e) The Readme is in good shape and it gives a good breif overview of the
   code. However it could be formatted so that it's easier to skim.

f) The build.xml file contains a "linenumbers" target that creates a
   file with the linenumbers added. This target may not be needed anymore.

g) It is possible to earn 1000pts with this project. The issues are clear.

h) Issue: https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-pokergame/issues/22

i) Except for a few confusing methods, most methods and classes in this 
   project are clear and organized. The methods and classes have a clear
   purpose. The code dependencies are clear:
   Card
   Deck <- Card, Hand
   Hand <- Card, Deck
   TabbedPane
   GetPropertyValues
   Pokergame(contains main) <- Deck, Card, Hand, TabbedPane, GetPropertyValues

Card.java: This class creates the cards used in decks and hands. This class looks good. 
           It might be a good Idea to include a hashCode method so you can compare cards.

Deck.java: This class creates the deck used by the project. The Reshuffle method could just
           remove cards from the deck instead of redeclaring it.
           
Hand.java: This class creates the set of cards each player has in their hand. Some of the 
           implementations like the sameHand method could be cleaner and easier to understand.
           The getHighCardValue method could reuse the getHighCard method.
           
GetPropertyValues.java: This class gets the number of wins that each player currently has.
                   The name of this class is a little confusing but its easy to understand when
                   you start looking at the code. The method getScores could use some comments to
                   explain what is going on and some of the exceptions thrown aren't really explained.
                   
TabbedPane.java: This class creates the windows for the instructions and rules. This class looks good.

Pokergame.java: This class contains the main and uses most of the other classes. This class also looks good.

j) There are Junit tests but there appears to only be tests for the hand comparisons in the hand class.
   I would expand the test coverage to include methods in the Deck class like reshuffle and deal cards. 
   I would also test some of the other methods in the hand class. When I implement new features I will write
   the test cases first when applicable and write just enough code to get the tests to pass.
